On my bedroom dresser is this amazing Lego spaceship set:

As I pull my clothes out for the day I often find myself looking at it and daydreaming about the possibilities. I've tried to build a solitaire game around this toy before but it never felt quite right. As I was cleaning off some dust on it today, I realized I had overlooked the ship's intended purpose. If you inspect the ship itself as well as the accessories, the rover vehicle, and the included astronaut mini-figs it is clear this is a Scout ship. It is made to explore the galaxy, find new worlds, survey, and recording their findings. Perfect for a solitaire hex- or point-crawl but not a playstyle I've typically gravitated to.

Several systems come to mind that would support this type of campaign "out of the box"; _[Classic Traveller][]_, _[Captain's Log][]_, _[Elite Dangerous][]_ with the _[Exploration][EDExplore]_ supplement, or _[Starforged][]_. Any of these would have the tools necessary to procedurally generate stars and their planets, species, settlements, and interesting survey sites. The procedural part is important to me because I'm always looking for a clear "what should do I next?" framework when I play solo. It is too easy to get stuck with the almost limitless set of options that roleplay provides. When you are in a group with a GM there are always people to bounce ideas off of but when it is just you it can become easy to get overwhelmed by the possibilities. Having a step-by-step "how do you survey a new subsector of space" checklist always gives you a on-ramp to getting your game going again.

With _Classic Traveller_ you have the option of sticking to the three "little black books" or turning things up to 11 by including _[Book 06 Scouts][]_ and Zozer Game's _[SOLO][]_ or _[HOSTILE: Solo][HOSTILE-Solo]_ (both include Survey/Explore procedural solo mini-games.)  If you want to really turn the dial well past 11 then you want the [_World Builder's Handbook_ from the MegaTraveller line][mt-wbh]. The amount of detail you will get from the _World Builder's Handbook_ is frankly overwhelming but it is probably the most comprehensive world generation tool I've ever seen for an RPG line. The tone of _Classic Traveller_'s procedural generation will give you a fairly wide range of play possibilities with variable worlds with wildly varying tech levels, populations, governments, etc. _Traveller_ would nicely support the multi-year or even multi-decade long exploration mission with the expectation that your ship is resupplying from the newly discovered worlds. In addition _Traveller_ supports random encounters at many places in game play which reduces the needs to rely on a GM emulator to inject unknown situations into play. If you wanted to dip your toe into the more modern Mongoose Traveller line there's even extremely affordable _[Traveller: Explorer Edition][]_.

_Elite Dangerous_ has a thorough star system generator and exploration mission generator in the core book. The _Exploration_ supplement provides solo-specific guidance on how to use these tools without a GM and provides additional Exploration Encounters to spice things up. It should be said that there are not "traditional" solo Oracle style tables or a yes/no system with these rules.

_Starforged_ will handle all of the procedural bits discussed above but it will tilt things towards a human-centered galaxy with broad tech level parity, sparsely populated planets, and quite a lot of weird alien stuff ("precursors") no one knows what to do with. _Starforged_ doesn't really do "random encounters" in the "wandering monster" sense but it does throw a wrench in the works from time-to-time via the native dice mechanics. I think _Starforged_ also works best if you treat the "Terminus" or "Outlands" as your homebase and you are working outwards towards the Expanse and Void for exploration. _Starforged_ will also not hold your hand quite as closely as say the Zozer Game's _Survey Scouts_ 13-step procedural checklist. With that said, every action taken Starforged follows a procedural mini-framework: "when you do X, do Y mechanically, and based on your result you can follow procedures A, B, or C". You are less likely to hit a point where you are completely stuck.

There's also _[Star Trek Adventures][]_ with the solo-specific _Captain's Log_ edition. Inside is a set of tools for creating and mapping new Human/Earth-like star systems and their inhabitants. This might be the only core book with a world generation tool that I've recommended which generates cultural religions if that's important to you. It closely models the episodic-style original Star Trek TV show format in my experience.

One game worth mentioning is an indie title is _[Welcome Aboard, Captain][]_ which also has a Star Trek vibe. It is a solitaire RPG where you take on the role of a starship captain and undertake missions. It is focused more on the "slice of life" side of exploring and it is not strictly scout-focused but it does provide a very solid framework and a tutorial mission with examples. For some folks the "crew management" aspect of exploration might be more interesting than the exploring itself.

There are other systems there that could handle parts of a Scout campaign (_Frontier Space_, _Stars Without Number_, etc) but I don't feel that these systems provide an end-to-end procedural game loop for exploration. There would be a lot more work on the "gamemaster" side of the solo player to keep the games moving along. That would mean using something like the _[Randomized Location Crafter][]_ from [Word Mill Games][]. It is worth noting that Word Mill also a system-netural _[Star System Creator][]_ which has one of the best generic name generators I've ever seen (you would still need something like the Location Crafter though to manage the "crawl" part of exploring the galaxy.)

Finally, you can of course mix-n-match games - using the world generation tools from one and the character creation & task resolution from another. It can be harder to decouple the procedural turn sequence from a game's rules than their world building tools, so keep that in mind when putting on the game designer hat and making your own game mashup.

I don't have one clear recommendation in this field - solo play is incredibly driven by your play style and personal goals. Myself I lean towards _Traveller_, _Starforged_, or building something around Word Mill Games' tools. _Traveller_ provides the quickest path to play with a solid set of procedural rules to follow. _Starforged_'s abstraction of supply and harm are incredibly tempting as I personally find too much bookkeeping overwhelming. The game designer in me loves the idea of using Word Mill's tools to make something that is purpose-fit for my goals.
