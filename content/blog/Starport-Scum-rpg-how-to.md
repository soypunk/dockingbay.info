+++

One piece of feedback I got on my [Starport Scum RPG introduction](/reviews/starport-scum-revisited/) from the grognards of the Nordic Weasel Games discord was that it didn't go into enough details about the nuts & bolts of running a session. So we are back with a second part where I to explain how I would play Starport Scum as an RPG campaign. I don't do one-shots but assuming that's what you wanted then pick a job from the book at random, use the character generation tables, and bob's your uncle.

I want to stress at this point that the "kid gloves" are off. I am assuming you have read and are familiar with the core rules of _Starport Scum_. I am going to stick to the core book as much as possible but I will point out how I would probably do things different given that I have a couple of terrabytes of RPG books at my disposal.

I think it is also important to note at this point that solo roleplaying is by it is nature deeply personal - every one is going to approach it differently. For me I don't use it as a vehicle to replace gaming with a group, I use it a means to get really deep into a game world in a way that is just not possible when you've got three other people arguing about whether or not we should just kill the shopkeeper now and take all their stuff.

There are two chapters in the book titled "The Campaign" & "Running the Game" which do their best to outline the framework that the designer expects players & GMs will use.

## Starport Scum RPG Campaign Preparation

1. Define the campaign premise. No procedure is provided for this step but I recommend using the "Local Problems" or "Sector Problems" random tables from "The World" section at the back of the book. 
2. If the crew will travel from planet-to-planet then generate 3-4 planets that will be featured at the start of the campaign. Otherwise generate a single world that will be the focus point of the campaign. The only procedure I see for generating planets is to use the "Worlds" tables in "The World."
3. If the campaign will be story driven, then use the "Story Hook" table to generate an initial plot direction.
4. Review and decide next actions.

### Walkthrough of Campaign Preparation

#### 1. Campaign Premise

I throw a D6 on the "Local Problems" table and I get a 3, "Resource shortage." 

> There is a widespread shortage on reactor fuel used by starships. Only a lucky few keep their ships flying by pirating and salvaging from others.

From the core book there are some other random table possibilities that might suggest a premise such as "Colony Secrets", "Conspiracies", or "News Headlines."

If you wanted a more advance system for generating a campaign premise I would suggest something like the _"Solo Setting & World Creation System"_ described in _[Mythic Magazine #38](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/471600/mythic-magazine-volume-38)_.

#### 2. Sketching out the world

The campaign premise best fits a crew that travels from planet-to-planet, so I generate 4 planets:

> 1. A frozen planet with a normal atmosphere has a government representative of the people which maintains a trade relationship with the sector government.
> 2. A temperate planet with an Earth-like atmosphere controlled by a military power who is at odds with the sector government.
> 3. A frozen planet with a toxic atmosphere is ruled by a planetary council that is in good standing with the sector government.
> 4. A desert planet with no atmosphere has a government representative of the people who are allied with the sector government.

If you do use the core book's tables then make note that many of them, including the job tables, suggest a central "sector government." You will need to work out for yourself what that entity is, how they operate, and how that relates to your crew.

There are countless other tools for generating planets that can be found in most Sci-Fi RPGs including just about any edition of _Traveller_. It all depends on how much detail you need to support your campaign premise. I personally prefer to start small in scope and then connect the dots to a larger picture because I find if I start at the big picture then my world building brain kicks in ("Oh, well how many different empires are there? What are they are like? What is their primary economy?"...)

Back to the result we have, the desert planet with no atmosphere could be a bunch of cities in domes but I wanted something different so I used the Space Station tables in the back of the book.

> - 751-Jump is a practically sized space station in outstanding condition protected by sector enforcement troops.

What this tells me is that there are jump gates in the setting and the space station is either a jump gate itself or was built adjacent to a jump gate to administer it. (Also "751" implies that is a vast galaxy with hundreds of jump gates.)

For naming these planets there is a "colony names" table but no planet names table. Again, lots of choices for this but I like the _"Star System Creator"_ planet name tables in _[Mythic Magazine #46](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/497555/mythic-magazine-volume-46)_. Using that gives me the following:

> 1. Careso
> 2. Rakoal
> 3. Elos
> 4. Peleuta

#### 3. The Story

I roll a 1d10 on the "Story Hooks" table and get a 9, "Searching for a person". Looking at the back of the book there's a "People Met" table which I roll a 1d20 on, getting a 5 or "Petty crook". 

> The crew has heard a rumor that a local thief has a tip on where to find a salvage.

#### 4. First session

Looking over all the material we have I decide the crew will run a Search job (from the [_"Bills to Pay"_ new jobs supplement][btp]) on "Careso, a frozen planet with a normal atmosphere has a government representative of the people which maintains a trade relationship with the sector government" (chosen at random by rolling a 1d4.) Looking at the table for the Search job I work out the rest of the details:

- The employer for the job is themselves
- The location is, rolling 1d6, a 6 or "Gang lair." HEAT factor increase by 2.
- The enemy is, rolling 1d6, a 3 or "Gangers"
- The target is a person.

The reward for this mission will be a little different than "rules as written", assuming the crew finds the target, they can get a guaranteed Salvage job.

## Starport Scum RPG Campaign Turn

I would still advise using the "Campaign Turn" premise in the rulebook for solo RPG-style play because it gives you a framework to fall back on when you get stuck. If you've got a good mind for what your PCs want to do and how the game world will react to their actions then you won't need to follow the turn procedure rigidly.

This is the rough procedure as outlined in the core book:

1. Resolve any links from the last encounter to this one.
2. Determine what the characters are doing and who they are encountering.
	1. If it is a Job:
		1. Decide if all crew members are going to job or if any are doing a "Trivial Job"
		2. Check for an "Unexpected Outcomes" (Roll d6 above the HEAT level to avoid)
		3. Set up and play out the tabletop battle. Remember to check for "Complications".
		4. (["Bills to Pay" expansion][btp]) After a Job, any Ace or Hero that did not go out of action during the battle can go gambling.
	2. If it is a random encounter determine the location, NPCs, and their reaction to the crew.
	3. If it is something else, define the goal of the encounter, and play until the crew meets or abandons the goal.
3. Determine any injuries, experience, recruiting, looting and bartering needed.
4. World Turn - either roll on the Campaign "Event" table or the "News Headlines."
5. Establish the next story step.

### Walkthrough Campaign Turn

I have created crew of three using the "Building Characters" rules. I went ahead and assigned the first character to be a Hero class character. The other two I rolled on the "Group Composition" to determine their class. I rolled a 2 and a 5, which gave me 1 Goon and 1 Ace. For the number of traits, there are guidlines or an option to roll randomly. I almost always chose to roll randomly so I rolled a 6 and got 4 traits for the Hero. For the Ace I rolled a 3 so just 1 trait. Goons don't have traits.

- Esther Shkee, Hero
	- Backstory: Got a decent job, moved up the ranks, shut down by the (sector) government
	- Traits (4): 
		- Snap shot: +1 die to shot if target not visible at beginning of move.
		- Hacker: +1 die when hacking
		- Leadership: +1 bonus when testing Morale.
		- Sidekick: Pick one goon. While they are within 2” of character, get +1 die to all actions. Bonus doesn’t apply if goon shoots.
	- Gear:
		- Basic pistol
		- "Lucky charm"
		- Pocket sized, bleeding edge, hacking (+1D) device		
- Ti Gleehand, Ace
	- Backstory: Joined the army, made good money, but gambled and lost it all
	- Traits (1):
		- Droid expert: +1 die when fixing, hacking or shooting at droids.
	- Gear:
		- Lock picks
		- Heavy Rifle +1D, ignores all defence dice
- Orn "Drip" Inthal, Goon
	- Backstory: Fought for a cause, made good money, lost everything to pirates and raiders
	- Gear:
		- Basic pistol
		- "Symbol or insignia from past history"

There are no individual name generators in the core rules so I turned to the name generation table in the [Mythic Gamemaster Emulator, 2nd Edition](https://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic.html)

#### Job Setup

I will play the job out "theater of the mind" style rather than with miniatures.

1. Complications: Rolling a 1d20 I get "Place 1D6 stim packs around the area." and some additional instructions. I guess because the location is a "Gang lair" there are some drugs lying around. If you ever read Jonathan Lethem's _"Gun, with Occasional Music"_ there is rampant drug usage almost mandated by the state government. People make their own mixes of drugs containing "Acceptol", "Avoidol", "Believol", "Forgettol", or "Regrettol" to deal with the oppressive nature of the dystopian future the book describes. Maybe that's what we are looking at from a world-building perspective. (There's also a hilarious bit in the book where when you pull out a gun and point it at someone it plays an ominous-like musical ring tone. We don't need to borrow that but that book is a wild ride, highly recommended if you like sci-fi & noir type stuff.)
2. The setup for a Search job is that there are three zones and each zone contains two possible spots the target could be. They'll be found if an adjacent figure rolls a 6 on a D6. If no one does this then the target has moved on and the mission is a bust. That's easy enough, we can basically make a point crawl for the Gang lair. One thing missing from Starport Scum is any kind of "terrain generator." I might use tools from either Two Hour Wargames 5150, Starforged's Location Delving tools, or the Location Crafter from Word Mill Games. I also might just decide for myself what is in "gang lair" based on common tropes from media I'm familiar with.
3. We also need to setup the occupants of the Gang lair - I hesitate to call them opposition because, being an RPG, I'd like to give the crew a chance to "talk things out", without resorting to violence (though, it probably will.)
4. "The Enemy" gives us means of generating the # of NPCs based on HEAT level. Ours is 2 so there will be 3 NPCs inside - 2 goons (2D) and 1 ace (3D). The ace is carrying a melee weapon which gives them a +1D when brawling.

#### Playing out the Search Job

This is going to be just raw notes, not all of the roleplaying that went on in my head. You can though I'm thinking about the sights, sounds, smells of the places I'm in. When there are character talking there is a conversation going on in my head, driven by the results of the dice.

1. The crew are blowing their credits away at a bar when Esther overhears that a local thief, Nahbae Tee, has a lead on a possible salvage.
2. The crew make their way to run down building where Nahabe is known to reside & work from. On their way they are passed by a "group of youth" who are "on the run" ("People Met", pg 70.) The crew isn't particularly concerned by this and is focused on getting the details of the salvage job.
3. Arriving at the location we make a "Reaction roll" (pg. 67), to see how the gangers react to the crew showing up. We roll a 6, which gives us "Friendly." We'll do a "Talking it Out" check, with Esther taking the lead. Because the gang is "Friendly" that puts them in the +1D "Receptive To" bonus column. Esther will roll 4d6 looking for at least one 5 or 6: [5*, 3, 1, 4]. The ganger at the entry and Esther talk for a bit and the ganger agrees to let the crew in and show them to where they last saw Nahbae.
4. Walking into a lounge-like area the crew rolls 1d6 looking for Nahbae but we roll a 1. There's no rule for this but each time we roll a 1 while searching I'm going to invoke the complication about the drugs lying around. I roll a 1d3 to randomly pick a crew member and get 2, so our Ace has a drug problem. They'll have to make the "saving throw" described in the complication rules which is to a roll a 1d6 and get anything higher than a 1. The Ace rolls and throws a 6 - they avoid the temptation of the drugs for now. There's a connected kitchen so the crew goes in to look but rolls another 1. Again, the Ace has to make the complication saving throw. They throw a two. I imagine the Ace is drawn to something but Esther steps and pulls them off of it for their own good.
5. Esther press the ganger from the door about where else Nahbae could be. Another Talking it Out roll I figure (trying to persuade the ganger to let search more of the lair.) Esther will throw 4d6: [6, 4, 6, 6] - 3 successes is a lot, so the ganger is enthusiastic about showing them upstairs to where Nahbae sometimes stays. By now I'm starting to think that this gang and Esther have some history together for whatever reason. Maybe the connection is the "decent job" that was "shut down by the (sector) government" which might be as simple as Esther and these folks were producing drugs together.
6. Once upstairs they visit Nahbae's room and knock on the door, throwing 1d6 we get a 5. No answer. Is the door unlocked? We'll use the "Question Table" from the _"Storyteller's Guide"_, throwing 2d10 I get a 9 & a 5 which means "Yes with a Discovery." There's no table for what nature of the discovery is which I don't love. I decide to roll the Search check again first but get a 5, so Nahabe is not in here either. Perhaps it is not just that the door is unlocked but that's slightly ajar and when the crew open the door they notice some signs that Nahbae had been recently here - a steaming hot cup of tea for example or a hastily unfinished bowl of hot ramen noodles.
7. Esther turns back to the ganger from the entry again - we've had quite a bit of success talking to them so they will show us to one last area where they could have gone. There's a set of stairs at the back of this floor which lead down to the rear of the lair. We throw our Search dice twice here just to speed things up but get a 3 and 1. The job is a bust... Nahbae has hastily made their exit. In fact this makes me rethink how cooperative the ganger from the door was - they were buying time for Nahbae to get out.

Now what? There is no loot or injuries to worry about because everything was exploring and talking - standard "setting up the big conflict" roleplaying in my book. The Search Job rules say we can repeat the job one last time, but if we fail that time the target is gone for good. We didn't need to use all of the detail the encounter generated (the exact number of NPCs and their stats) and that's fine in my book because we are playing an RPG primarily.

It is not really an injury but the complication of the drugs has added some backstory to our Ace crew member, they've got a past problem with drug usage.

Looking back at our procedure list, I see we should check for a world event. I roll a 1d20 on the Campaign Event table and get "New resource node discovered."  You could roll on the Factions table to figure out "who" discovered these new resources but I think it just makes that the Sector Government has discovered a possible source of reactor fuel. They will tightly control who gets the fuel and a what cost. Doesn't really change the campaign premise but makes it more likely that the Sector Government can field starships to patrol the space lanes.

I would probably do a little downtime roleplaying to inform where the crew would expect to perform the next Search Job. There's the location table for the Search Job but now that we are following someone around on planet, I think I would want something more specific. Something like the _"[Augmented Reality, The Holistic City Kit For Cyberpunk Games](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/202175/augmented-reality-the-holistic-city-kit-for-cyberpunk-games)"_. Rolling on the location table there I get "Public Transport Hub" which is great - the crew gets wind that Nahbae is trying to make their way to the starport. Whatever salvage they know about it is possibly a bigger deal than we originally imagined.

Now, the miniatures grognards might scoff at this session - no combat? Sure I mean that's kinda the thing that separates narrative miniatures gaming and roleplaying from just straight up knocking painted figures over. If you ever played _"Classic Traveller"_ and did the daily and weekly encounter checks - if you strictly did it rules-as-written with no gamemaster injecting themselves to ratchet up the action - you will find that often entire weeks can go by with nothing randomly driven happening. Either you have to roleplay out what the downtime looks like or get the ship crew invested in some speculative trading or picking up a passenger delivery. 

To me this session is meaningful - we randomly setup a premise that salvage is important, we randomly determined that the crew was searching for someone who could lead them to their next salvage. When the crew went to talk to them, they got out just in time - who tipped them off that the crew was coming for them? That's an unresolved story hook. We randomly determined Nahbae was heading to the "public transport hub" - trying to put distance between themselves and the crew. What planet are they going to? I'd probably roll 1d4 on the planets we generated from earlier if we get the same planet we are on then I'd use that as a prompt to generate a 5th planet.

Why didn't Nahbae stick around when the crew arrive - they could have worked out a deal to split the share of the salvage job. The dice could've given us that option but didn't. There's another faction involved - could be a rival crew - that wants the salvage. Will there be a race for the salvage or a fight at the salvage site to control it? Now we've got all the ingredients for a narratively driven skirmish battle that has higher stakes. That's the benefit of a game like _"Starport Scum"_ that merges RPG elements with the miniatures gaming.

## Final Thoughts

This is how I would get the ball rolling with Starport Scum. Eventually as you run through the campaign turn procedure enough times, you will have history - allies, rivals, enemies, etc. Those things will greatly influence the context for each random table roll you make and speed up the time from interpretation of a random table result to something your PCs can act on.

There's also a cautionary tale here about pre-prep. I did very little in the scheme of things and even then I only need an incredibly limited portion of that to play out the first crew encounter. Don't prep too much upfront, just enough to give you some context to constrain the random results you will roll up so that they make sense.
