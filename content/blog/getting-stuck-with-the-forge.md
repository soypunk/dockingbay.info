Lately, I've had a few false starts on getting a campaign-oriented solo game going. Now, if I had set my expectations to "run a few one-shots with different rules systems" I would have been pretty happy with my gaming over the last few months.

Sometimes your solo gaming gets stuck from a form of "creative burnout." Anytime you are creating stuff constantly there's a chance you tap out those resources but that's not what's been hampering my games. I've been bouncing around different solo frameworks and rules systems of late, some of which has been brought on by handling so many playtesting requests.

I find when my games get stuck the best thing to do is to turn the procedural game play up to eleven and for that you need a framework that supports it. The best Sci-Fi titles for this are anything from the Two Hour Wargames _5150_ line, Dwarfstar's _Star Smuggler_, and _Ironsworn: Starforged_ in my opinion. _5150_ and _Star Smuggler_ both come with pre-made settings and a set of procedures to follow like a boardgame that will keep your experience moving forward. _Ironsworn: Starforged_ comes with a procedure-heavy upfront game world building framework that establishes what is "true" about your setting and leaves you with a number of "quests" to undertake to poke at the edges of the setting to find out more things that are "true." 

The last time I played _Ironsworn: Starforged_ "rules as written" was back in the playtesting period and since I've played a bunch but heavily homebrewed. Feeling a bit stuck but wanting a long-running game I've back to _Ironsworn: Starforged_ and I'm trying to stick to running the game as designed.

After about 30 minutes of doing the "Truths Exercise" & character creation I was left with a very solid start:

- After a catastrophic war caused a mass exodus from our previous home, five founding clans have emerged who are trying to establish dominion of "The Forge."
- Based on a "Quest Starter" from one of the selected Truth options and a randomly rolled backstory for my character, an additional detail became "true": Folks are thrown out of clans from time-to-time and these outcasts are known as "Travellers." A fringe group called the Travellers Assistance Community (TAC) has formed to provide mutual aid to Travellers. After thinking through the Truths and the backstory I thought it would be interesting to twist the concept of what a "classic traveller" was and the "Traveller's Aid Society" into something more desperate. People who become Travellers are still highly competent and resilient but their social status is in question in The Forge.
- There is near constant war going on in The Forge and many Travellers are those who refused to fight for their respective clans. Most Travellers believe their clans are chewing up and spitting out clans members in service of supporting a limited few who control power.
- For the quest starter I choose:
	- _"A forsaken people, sworn to no clan, live on an orbital station. A recent illness left many sick or dead. Supplies are urgently needed. Why were these people exiled, and why do you swear to give them aid? Which clan stands against you?"_
	- I've discussed the "Why were these people exiled" question above.
	- As to "why do you swear to give them aid?", I envisioned my character as the best pilot amongst a small group of Travellers who are living out of an asteroid. Because I am the best pilot and navigator, it is hoped I can find the necessary medical supplies quickly.
	- "Which clan stands against you?" I assume this is one of the five founder clans and mostly used the factions tool in Starforged but also brought in some of the faction tables from The Perilous Void to envision this one. I come up with "The Portos", a founder clan interested in commerce who is fighting for control of trade routes in The Forge. They are ruled by an Oligarchical elite who have an interested in establishing a monopoly on trade goods throughout The Forge, including medical supplies. Our group cannot afford their exorbitant prices and must attempt to sneak through their patrols and trade blockades to obtain the necessary supplies.
	
As you can see this is a pretty rich background environment to play in without doing a hour of world building. There are tons of hooks to use as a player/gm to keep the story moving forward - both for the starter quest and future quests. If you aren't interested in this type of world building, then I suggest the Two Hour Wargames or Star Smuggler options as better for just jumping-in and playing _right now_.
