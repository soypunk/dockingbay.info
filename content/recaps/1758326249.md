The dame was trouble and you didn't need a retina-scanner to see it. She moved through the haze of the Starlight Lounge like a ghost through smog, all sharp angles and nervous energy, a silhouette cut from expensive shadows against the garish neon glow of the Lounge's exterior signage.

I was nursing a glass of synth-whiskey, the kind that tastes like regret and burnt circuits, trying to ignore the thrum of tramp freighters shaking the cheap permaglass. The bar was its usual symphony of lowlifes and high hopes: smugglers with quick eyes, dockworkers blowing a week's pay on overpriced liquor, a couple of corporate suits so polished you could see your mistakes reflected in their shined shoes.

"Mr. Lundoun?" said the dame who had made a beeline for my corner booth. She slid into the seat opposite me without an invite. Up close, the trouble had details. Eyes the color of a terraformed ocean, wide with a fear she was trying hard to ice over. She wore a sleek, black number that probably cost more than my aircar, and it fit her like a second skin. Her hands, clasped on the table, were elegant but trembling. No ring.

“The last time I checked,” I grunted, taking a slow pull from my glass. The whiskey did nothing. It never does. “And you’re a woman who doesn’t like to waste time. Or you’re being followed. Which is it?”

A flicker of surprise. “Both,” she admitted. Her eyes darted towards the entrance, a quick, bird-like motion. "I was checking up on my brother at his apartment but I found the door ajar and his place torn apart. When I left the building, I felt like someone was following me. I called a friend, Kayla Thorne, and she told me you could help."

That would explain the calls I ignored from my assistant.

"Sure, Miss..."

"Piper. Piper Wade."

“You call the Badges too?”

"Unified Security? No." She hesitated like a poorly maintained engine. "My brother was mixed up in some things and I haven't heard from him in over a week."

The word "things" landed on the table between us with a thud you could feel in your teeth. Suddenly the synth-whiskey tasted even worse. I looked at her and saw a scared, angry, beautiful dame in a spaceport bar, smelling of jasmine and desperation. Desperation could mean credits.

I told her my daily rate (plus expenses) and she didn't run off as fast as she came in. I finished my drink, the glass clicking on the table like a final verdict.

"The trick with missing people is figuring out if they ran, fell, or were pushed."

It was going to be one of those cases. I could feel it in my bones, right next to the old aches from the last time I’d tangled with the local crime syndicates. She was trouble, all right. The worst kind. The paying kind.

## Session Notes

I was just lamenting on [Andy Slack's blog](https://sablemage.blogspot.com) about my ideal game engine when it occurred to me that [_Starport Scum_](https://nordicweasel.posthaven.com) almost checks all the boxes: an adventure skirmish game system that primarily uses a six-sided dice pool and does a lot in very few words. It has a few holes but we can plug them by using [_Perilous Void_](https://lampblack-brimstone.itch.io/the-perilous-void), [_5150 Working Grave_](https://twohourwargames.com), and the [_Mythic Gamemaster Emulator_](https://www.wordmillgames.com) to plug any others.

> "When the Cops won’t do, they hire you."

I created a "Hero" character in _Starport Scum_ and then used the PI scenario setup procedure from _5150 Working Grave_ to get the ball rolling.

I have no idea how long I can maintain interest in writing up sessions in a style faithful to hardboiled noir but it felt fun today.

My PI is Dalin Lundoun. He's a natural brawler, charming, and has good awareness of his immediate surroundings. Per Starport Scum's rules I gave him a gear roll on the loot table and he picked up a special pistol which can either fire 2 shots or get +1d6 to a single. Sounds kinda like the "Big Ass Pistol" or BAP-2 from 5150.

For the Scenario type, _Working Grave_ gave me "Case Building" and the target was a brother and the client a sister. In one example Case Building pitches a jealous spouse digging up dirt on their partner. I asked Mythic a Detail Question and that spun me towards the idea that the Sister is concerned about her Brother, who _Working Grave_ told me was a "Criminal" - more specifically a "Thief." But because it is "Case Building" I don't know yet why the Brother is missing - kidnapped, dead, or something else?

For the opening location... well I choose that whether than generate it because it is "Starport Scum" after all and I felt we should start there at the tried and true roleplaying game tavern setup. It also fits the genre I'm going which is kinda of a grounded sci-fi noir setup.
