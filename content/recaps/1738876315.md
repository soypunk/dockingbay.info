# Frontier Zone, Stakes, _The Red Runner_

_OVER BLACK_

_Sounds of many voices in a crowded hall_

_Fade up music, [Stray Cat Strut][2]_

_Fade in: INTERIOR. Crowded, Upscale, Glitzy Casino. A large cat-like humanoid wearing a heavy long coat sits on a stool at a busy bar counter. Fade out music._

Grawl knocks back the rest of his beer, drops a few Galactic Standard Credits on the counter, and stands up from the bar. He walks toward the gaming tables but turns his attention to a nervous female looking Arsubaran who is speed walking through the casino floor. They are constantly looking over their shoulder and Grawl follows their gaze. Two other pale-skinned Arsubarans and a green-skinned Ken Reeg appear to be casually following the female.

The fur on Grawl's body prickles with a sense of urgency and his natural distrust of the Ken Reeg species. He looks around, trying to identify an exit point but doesn't see an obvious one from _The Red Runner_'s sprawling casino floor. He turns back to the female and sees that has bumped into another green-skinned Ken Reeg who is holding on to her shoulders. She stuggles to get away until the Ken Reeg slaps her and then Grawl sees something he's never seen before -- the female starts to shudder, fur grows over her body and she turns into a 7 foot tall white-furred half-wolf, half-humanoid. The half-wolf roars and tosses the Ken Reeg aside.

Grawl rushes over to the prone Ken Reeg and places his foot on their throat. 

"You fight without honor. Why did you assault that person?"

The Ken Reeg who is choking blurts out "Geez man, back off." (cough) "You saw what she is."

Grawl reaches down and searches the Ken Reeg's suit jacket. He finds a few Credits and a syringe with some type of serum in it. He lifts his foot and heads off in the direction of the half-wolf who is turning over game tables to make a barrier from their pursuers.

The pale-skinned Arsubarans have drawn stun guns and have them aimed at the half-wolf. The first Ken Reeg Grawl saw is standing away from the commotion talking on a comm unit. Grawl breaks into a run, drops into slide and rams his feet into one of the Asubarans, knocking the stun gun free. He propels himself back onto his feet and grabs the arm of the other Arsubaran, ripping the stun gun out with his other hand. He puts both hands onto the Arsubaran's arm and tries to fling him at the other but the target dodges out of the way. One of the Arsubarans pulls out a switchblade and charges at Grawl but Grawl tosses them aside. Grawl's claws protract, swiping at the Arsubaran's face, ripping several gashes into their skin and damage an eye. The Arsubaran drops the knife, falls to the floor holding their face. The other Arsubaran flees.

The half-wolf is staggering backwards, hesitantly walking away from the violent scene Grawl has unleashed.

"I am not going to hurt you." Grawl says to the wolf as their claws retract back and Grawl holds out their hands in calming motion.

The half-wolf growls at Grawl and bears their teeth.

"I am not working for the dishonorable Reegs. I will help you get to safety."

The half-wolf picks up a piece of furniture and throws it at Grawl. It hits Grawl square and knocks him off his feet. The half-wolf roars, tosses a gaming table aside, and starts at a full run through the casino.

Grawl get back on his feet, follows, and moves into the next room, which he finds empty of people. He looks around and sniffs at the air to track the half-wolf's trail. Following along he finds a necklace on the ground that he remembers seeing hanging from the half-wolf's neck. He pockets the necklace and proceeds into a hallway. There are signs of the rampaging wolf leftover but Grawl also spots a pair of local police at the end of the corridor. The police yell at him to halt.

Grawl looks up into the paneled ceiling and observes a large air recycling return vent. He leaps up and grabs onto the vent with his hands, pulling it down. He leaps again, trying to grab onto a ledge to pull himself up but fails. The police are closing now, continue to yell at him and drawing their own firearms. He looks around the hallway for any exit, a door, anything but there's none.

Grawl holds up his hands and tells the approaching police "I'm unarmed and I have a Bounty Hunters license to operate in the GCP."

## Session Notes

First of all, please don't write in with critiques of the screenwriting notes at the beginning, I know they are not "industry standard." They were written in the _spirit_ of screenwriting and intended for a wider audience, not a Hollywood scripting reading one. K? Thanks.

This session was the result of wanting to try out some new playtesting material for the _Mythic RPG, Second Edition_ and when thinking of an existing setting I could use the first thing that came to mind was the very well support universe of [_Bulldogs!_][1]. The opening scene was generated with a Mythic GME random event. I have envisioned a bit about the player character, Grawl, beforehand but the female character was created with the Mythic One Page Character Crafter. The scene location came from _Bulldogs!: Ports of Call - Galactic Central Point_ but I picked it based on details from Mythic's random event process. Every other important detail or action was handled with a mixture of Mythic RPG or Mythic GME rules & tools.

I've been playtesting material for Tana Pigeon's upcoming Mythic RPG, Second Edition for some time. There's been some new updates specifically to PC and NPC design and I wanted to try them out. As the Mythic RPG is "descriptor" based, pulling material from the Fate versions of _Bulldogs!_ is straightforward. In addition to character creation some revised combat rules are available to tinker with so I wanted this session to feature a bit of that.

I have the entire _Bulldogs!_ collection (D20, two versions of Fate, plus Fiasco and Technoir variants) and it is always seemed a shame that I have not better utilized the material. With the state of the real world becoming increasingly grim, _Bulldogs!_ provides a nice balance of action and corporations run amok but with a Douglas Adams-like brush of humor.

There's quite a bit of established _Bulldogs!_ setting material but it always does job of filling enough detail _up to a point_. Clearly designed with the intent of letting the gamemaster plop bits in and flavor or restyle as needed. There's a galaxy map but it is very abstract:

!["Galaxy map broken into three major areas, the Union of the Saldralla, Frontier Zone, and the Devalkamanchan Republic. A few major worlds are marked. Stakes is in the Frontier Zone."](/images/bulldogs-galaxy.png)

There's enough room in setting to dial the atmosphere from 80s-style Cassette Futurism to the high-gloss of Farscape. Some species details to help you ground yourself:

- Ryjyllians: Feline-humanoid warrior race
- Arsubarans: An analog for humans in _Bulldogs!_
- Ken Reeg: "70s Disco-styled" green humans, charming, morally and ethically flexible.
- Stakes: An pleasure world, dominated by casinos
- GCP: Galatic Central Point, the central hub of the Frontier Zone.
