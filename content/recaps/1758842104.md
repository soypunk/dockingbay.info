The Starlight Lounge's front door was for tourists and suckers. The back door was for people with problems.

"The night's young, and so are my mistakes," I grunted, standing up. "Let's take the scenic route."

The alley behind the joint was a canyon of brick and overflowing dumpsters, smelling of stale beer and broken promises. The moon was a sliver of dirty fingernail in the sky, not doing much except making the dark look darker. We'd taken about three steps when two shapes detached themselves from the gloom. Goons. The kind bred in bulk down at the Starport's loading docks; thick necks, thicker skulls, and fists like sacks of gravel.

No introductions. They never bother. The first one came in low, a bull charging a gate. I sidestepped, letting their momentum do the work for me. My right hand connected with his jaw with a sound like a walnut cracking in a vice. He folded up neat and tidy and didn't move again. One down.

The other one was different. He taunted me with a husky voice. He didn't rush. He circled, a predator who knew his business. He was bigger, and the way he held his hands said he'd been paid to hurt people before. We traded blows, the alley echoing with the sound of knuckles on flesh. A hook caught me on the ribs, sending a jolt of fire through my side. I gave him one back, but it was like punching a side of beef. He shoved me, and my heels slid on something wet and greasy. I stumbled, catching myself against a dumpster. The world did a lazy spin.

He came at me again, a grin splitting his ugly mug. I was off-balance, playing defense. Another shove sent me reeling. My back hit the brick wall, and the air left my lungs in a grunt. He thought he had me. He telegraphed a haymaker from downtown, a wild, looping punch meant to put my lights out for a week. It was the mistake I'd been waiting for.

I dropped into a crouch. The wind of his miss rustled my hair. For a second, he was wide open, his whole body leaning into the nothing he'd just hit. I put everything I had left into one shot, rising up from the floor, my fist connecting square under his chin. His head snapped back, his eyes rolled up white, and he went down like a felled tree, landing next his pal in a heap of bad intentions.

I stood there, sucking in the foul air, my knuckles bleeding and my ribs screaming. The dame was watching from the doorway, her eyes wide.

"These the stooges who followed you?" I asked. She nodded and I knelt down to search their pockets. The night was young, and the bill for this little fracas was about to come due.

## Session Notes

- I used the alpha combat rules from the upcoming Starport Scum second edition, ran very smoothly though I had to do a bit of thumbing through the original rules and the new ones to reference terminology.
- Rather than "test for an encounter" or whatever, it just made sense to me that the goons who followed our client would try to jump us and would guess we wouldn't leave by the front door. Goons aren't the sharpest but they've seen this movie before. I could've asked Mythic, etc etc but sometimes in solo you just have to make those GM calls without the randomizers.
- Starport Scum says the "larger party" goes first in combat but the two parties were the same size. I generated the party size based on the procedures in Starport Scum's "The Enemy" section. I decided to follow the "Initiative" rules (which kick in after the first round) and the Goons got to move first.
- Again, I tried to capture the genre styling in the write-up but after the goons activated as a grouped pair, they closed distance with movement and I asked Mythic whether they would stay hidden or reveal themselves. Mythic had them reveal themselves so we entered into Melee combat. They did pin me with their first brawling attacks but no damage. Then I took out the first goon quickly and I thought it might end the same for the second goon but they rolled extremely well. They kept pinning my character and even though they were just tokens on a VTT map, I could feel the back and forth of the punching battle. Finally the remaining goon totally Fumbled a roll - when you roll no hits and all 1s in Starport Scum something bad happens usually - in this case I got to counter attack with my full dice (instead of the usual 1d6 counter-attack Starport offers.) My character then nearly aced their roll and scored three hits. That was lights out for the goon.
