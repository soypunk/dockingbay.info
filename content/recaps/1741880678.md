As I don't feel like cleaning these up into a narrative recap, here are the raw notes of Grawl's most recent adventure I did using [Freeform Universal](https://perilplanet.itch.io/fu-classic) and the [Mythic GME](https://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic.html).

My friend and illustrator, [Hodag](https://nofoesnotraps.wordpress.com), made this portrait of Grawl which I think is fantastic:

- `Does Grawl have the initiative?: 1d6: [6] = Yes, and...`
- Grawl and Tera are walking into the docking bay with Grawl's ship when Grawl's nose picks up the scent of something alarming.
- `Are there cargo crates? Ask the GM, Likely [60]: Yes`
- Grawl directs Tera to stand behind a set of crates along the edges of the docking bay.
- Grawl reaches into his trench coat and readies his pistol.
- "I smell your fear snake. Reveal yourself and fight with honor."
- `Does Grawl intimidate the hunter into a fair fight? (+Ryjyllian) 2d6k1: [4, 1d] = Yes, but (Unknown to Grawl, the Septercian is not alone.)`
- A Septercian steps out from the shadows. "Grawwl. Have you lost your acquisition?"
- Grawl asks "What's your claim to the target?"
- Septercian replies "Contract from Medbase Ultra."
- Grawl says "Multiple contracts for the same target is a violation of Guild rules."
- The Septercian keeps inching closing to Grawl and says "Not a Guild job, Kitty."
- One of the Septercian's long arms attempt knock the pistol out of Grawl's hands.
- `Does Grawl dodge the attack? (+Initiative advantage, +Athletic, -Martial arts) 2d6k1: [5, 4d] yes`
- Grawl moves out of the way and points his pistol up at the Septercian's jaw line.
- `Does Grawl's Pistol shot hit? (+Pistol, +Athletic, -Martial arts) 2d6k1: [5d, 5] = 5 Yes, 2 Harm. Septercian Stamina goes from 8 -> 6`
- The Septercian's jaw hangs loose and they use their powerful leaping ability to get onto a crate and then back down on to Grawl's head.
- `Does Grawl avoid the Septercian's physical air attack? (+Athletic, -Martial arts) 1d6: [1] = No, and. Deals 2*2 = 4Harm. Grawl's Stamina goes from 12 -> 8`
- The Septercian comes down hard on Grawl and knocks him prone.
- `Does this anger Tera? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [7]: Exceptional Yes`
- Tera, who is trembling, emerges from the crate where she had been staying out of the way. "Can I play too?" She begins her transformation into a werewolf.
- The Septercian sizes up the situation.
- Grawl shakes his head, woozy from the drop kick, and begins to stand up.
- `Does the Septercian bring out his goons? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [21]: Yes`
- The Septercian raises a hand and motions with his claws for assistance. Two Ken Riggs appear, one sporting a bruise from the last time he encountered Grawl. One has something like a large animal "net gun" and then the other is sporting a pistol.
- `The Ken Riggs are basic mooks, 4 Stamina each, no special descriptors besides their gear.`
- Grawl tries to drop and roll, firing off a shot quickly at the Ken Rigg with a net-gun
- `Does Grawl's shot hit? (+Athletic, +Pistol) 2d6k1: [6, 5d] = Yes, add... 2*2 = 4 Harm. The Ken Rigg Drops to the ground.`
- The Septercian growls, sprints towards Grawl and tries to throw a kick aimed at Grawl's chest, attempting to knock him down again.
- `Does Grawl avoid the kick? (+Athletic, -Martial Arts) 1d6k1: [5] = Yes.`
- Grawl rolls the opposite away of the kick.
- `Has Tera completed her transformation? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [42]: Yes.`
- Tera, now in full wolf form, is drooling and her eyes look wild. She charges the other Ken Rigg, attempting to wrap her arms around the Ken Rigg and wrestle them to the ground.
- `Does Tera grapple with the Ken Rigg? (+wolf) 2d6k1: [5d, 6] = Yes, and...`
- `Not entirely sure what the Septercian would do so I ask Mythic an Element Focus question: What is the Septercian character combat action? SKILL OR ABILITY: They use a skill or ability. For instance, a mage casts a spell or a doctor uses their medical expertise. The Septercian's is skilled in martial arts and is trained as an assassin. Their main ability is that have poisoned spurs on their forearms and shins. Seeing as the Septercian is on their heels here, I think they would go for the poison.`
- The Septercian bends their arm to expose one of the venomous spines on their forearm and tries to bash Grawl's shoulder with it.
- `Does Grawl avoid the attack? (+Athletic, -Martial Arts, -Poison) 1d6: [2] = No. Grawl Stamina 8 -> 6. +Condition: Poisoned.`
- The spine stabs into Grawl's body and he roars with pain. It will take `1d6: [4] turns` before Grawl passes out from the venom.
- Tera is on top of the Ken Rigg and throws a punch at his face
- `Does Tera's punch land? (+wolf) 2d6k1: [2d, 4] = Yes, but... 2 Harm. Ken Rigg Stamina 4 -> 2.`
- Tera wildly punches at the Ken Rigg and connects but her movements lack control and the Ken Rigg is able to get free.
- Grawl with the Septercian's forearm still lodged in him, extends his claws and attack the Septercian's face
- `Does Grawl's claw attack strike? (+Claws, +Athletic, -Poisoned, -Martial Arts) 1d6: [5] = Yes. Septercian's Stamina 6 -> 4.`
- The Septercian pulls their forearm out and steps back, raising a hand to feel the claw marks Grawl has left on their face. "I will enjoy eating your carcass, Ryjyllian."
- The Ken Rigg, freed from Tera's grip dives for the net gun.
- `Does the Ken Rigg grab the gun? 1d6: [3] = No, but...`
- `Not sure what the but is so I roll on Mythic' Action meaning tables: Overthrow, Hindrance. I have an idea now.`
- The net gun is out of reach but on the ground the Ken Rigg sees the sedation viral of serum Grawl took from them at the casino. The vial must have fallen out of Grawl's trenchcoat during the scuffles.
- The Septercian is walking around Grawl in a defensive manner, trying to drag out the fight, knowing that the poison's effect are on his side.
- Tera focuses her rage on the prone Ken Rigg, trying to grab at his legs.
- `Does Tera grab the Ken Rigg's legs? (+wolf) 2d6k1: [6, 5d] = Yes, and...`
- `Is the docking bay platform high in the air? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [5]: Exceptional Yes`
- Grabbing the Ken Rigg's legs, Tera drags him away, lifts him up by his legs and tosses him over the side of the docking bay.
- Grawl is holding his shoulder and feeling weaker. He too sees the net gun on the ground and tries to kick it over towards Tera.
- `Does Grawl managed to get the net gun to Tera? (+Athletic, -poisoned) 1d6: [4] = Yes, but...`
- Grawl kicks the net gun to Tera but stumbles and falls to the ground.
- The Septercian watches the net gun go sliding by but Grawl's fall catch his attention. He starts walking towards Grawl, hoping to deliver a killing blow.
- Tera sees this, picks up the net gun and fires it at the Septercian
- `Does Tera's shot snare the Septercian? (+netgun) 2d6k1: [5, 3d] = Yes.`
- The net shoots out of the gun, ensnaring the Septercian.
- Grawl gets back on his feet only to stumble over again and pass out.
- The Septercian is fighting with the net, trying to break fee.
- `Does the Septercian find a way out of the net? (+Trained Killer) 2d6k1: [1d, 2] = No.`
- Tera grabs a hold of the net around the Septercian and tries to toss him over the docking bay's edge as well.
- `Does Tera manage to toss the Septercian over the side? (+wolf) 2d6k1: [4d, 5] = Yes`
- The Septercian goes over the edge as well. Tera pickups the lifeless Ken Rigg body from the ground and tosses it over along with a few crates for good measure before passing out.
- `Does law enforcement come to check out why so many things are falling from the docking bay? Ask the GM, Likely [77]: No (Event). Event Focus: Move Away From a Thread. I think I know what's happening here.`

## Scene 2

    Expected Scene: Tera is flying Grawl's starship
    Scene Check, [5] vs. 4 = Expected

- `Does Grawl's ship have a medical bay? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [19]: Yes`
- Tera is flying Grawl's starship and receives a notice from the ship's AI "Grawl has stabilized." Tera interacts with the ship and sets a course for autopilot, then unstraps from the pilot seat to check on Grawl. "Hey big guy."
- Grawl is confused about where he is. Tera explains that they both passed out on the docking bay. When Tera came to she tried to get into Grawl's ship but need Grawl's biometrics to access it so she dragged him over and then on board.
- "What about the lizard? The _Red Runner_ goons?"
- "Gone. I don't know... I fought with the Ken Riggs... my memory is hazy."
- Grawl sits up and takes notice of his surroundings, then looks at his shoulder.
- "Your ship helped me with an antidote."
- "I am in your debt."
- "I am in your starship... alive. I think we can call it even."
- Grawl and Tera share a meal. Tera tells him where she has set course for.
- `Both characters should have their Stamina reset to full`
- `Do they encounter another starship? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [43]: Yes.`
- `Ship Reaction Throw: ([5,1]+0=6) Neutral`
- `Perilous Void spaceship - Form: Tractor, Size: Medium, Feature: Pockmarks/scratches, Function: Search & Rescue.`
- `Borrowing a page from 5150 I consider this a neutral PEF I can ignore if I choose to and I do.`

## Scene 3

    Expected Scene: Arrival at Gunbarrel Station
    Scene Check, [4] vs. 3 = Expected

- The starship arrives at Gunbarrel Station which "looks like a long, hollow tube rotating on its long axis to provide gravity along the inside of the tube."
- `Are they able to get a docking bay without issue? Ask the GM, 50/50 or Unknown [48]: Yes`
- Tera and Grawl are looking at a computer screen, it shows a warrant out for their arrest in connection to the murder of the two Ken Riggs.
- "Remind me why you chose Gunbarrel?"
- "Your ship said you had a contact here. I asked it to take us somewhere safe."
- `I picked Gunbarrel by pulling a Bulldogs! book, "Ports of Call - The Frontier Zone", from my collection and rolling a d12 against several pre-built locations. From that side book I borrowed an NPC, "Brrowr", who is a fellow Ryjyllian with a cybernetic left arm that operates. She serves as an engineer aboard a ship that operates out of Gunbarrel.`
- "Brrowr. Not sure how she can help us though. We should refuel, resupply, and get out of the Frontier Zone. Gunbarrel will have its fair share of bounty hunters and we have a warrant."
- The pair discuss where else to go, each talking the other out of returning to their respective homeworlds.
- "I will go to the Bounty Hunter's Guild office and explain to them why this warrant is unjust."
- Tera thinks that is a bad idea. Grawl believes with his starship's security cam footage of the docking bay encounter he can justify the outcome.
- `Is there an encounter leaving the docking bay? Ask the GM, Unlikely [11]: Yes (Event)`
- `Event Focus: Current Context`
- An inspector flanked by a twelve-person security detail approaches the starship. "Grawl awp Mawr awp Hsyrrl of Clan Myip and Tera Valene you are under arrest for the murder of two citizens from the Alliance of Federated Frontier States. Please turn around and place your hands behind your back."

## Session Notes

It has been a few years since I've used Freeform Universal but it worked really well. I once described Freeform Universal as "Oracle, the game" because of how the resolution system works.

1. Frame your in-game action as a question, much like you would a Mythic GME Fate Question.
2. Build a dice pool, starting with one dice. Then make a list of the beneficial and hindering descriptors that influence the question. A beneficial descriptor cancels out one hindering descriptor. The remaining total of uncanceled descriptors is added to your dice pool. If you are only left with beneficial descriptors then you roll the dice and keep the highest and if the remaining descriptors are hindering you roll the dice and keep the lowest.
3. Compare the dice result to the following table:

| #  | Result      | 
| -: | :---------- | 
|  6 | Yes, and... | 
|  5 | Yes...      | 
|  4 | Yes, but... | 
|  3 | No, but...  | 
|  2 | No...       | 
|  1 | No, and...  | 

One could say "looks like a yes/no oracle, why bother with Mythic?" The really interesting thing Mythic does is unpredictably weave together Scenes, Threads, & Characters - the Fate Question is a skeleton that many of Mythic's systems are built around but if all you are using Mythic for is yes/no questions then you are missing out on the good parts.

I also find the resolution outcomes to be the sweet spot between say Starforged (Strong Hit, Weak Hit, and Miss) and FFG Star Wars/Genesys (which has something like 100+ possible outcomes.)

Speaking of _Star Wars_, I think we will take a break from _Bulldogs!_ as I'm hankering to run something in the _Andor_ and _Rebels_ period of the setting.
