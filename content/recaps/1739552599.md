# Frontier Zone, Stakes, Local Police Station

"Your credentials are cleared." says the Police officer as they slide Grawl's Bounty Hunter license chip and handheld across the table. Grawl takes the chip and inserts it into the back of his handheld computer and sets to his side.

The Police officer places a data pad screen in the middle of the table with a security camera photo of the women Grawl spotted. Every minute the photo changes to one of the woman as half-wolf and then back to original. "I have a few questions about this acquisition target. We've checked our local records along with those on InfoCity and there's not much to go on, no criminal record. Medbase Ultra is the Originator of this contract?"

Grawl nods.

"And the Application Conditions?"

"Alive."

"Was the target a patient?"

"The client did offer this detail and I did not ask. I was told that the target was not considered to be armed or dangerous. Clients often leave important details out."

The Police officer sighs in a shared understanding.

"Ok. The property damaged will be billed to Medbase Ultra as there's nothing in this permit that would suggest you could've know the target would turn violent but I will be fining you for assaulting employees of _The Red Runner_. You can settle your bill and collect your remaining belongings at the desk outside. You are free to go."

Grawl's facial expression does not change but he considers how quickly he could rip the officer's limbs off.

"Would you be willing to share the InfoCity data on the target? It would help me neutralize the threat."

The Police Officer looks behind Grawl at the mirrored glass behind them and then back to Grawl. "We can assist with that."

Grawl rises up, standing a good foot taller than the officer. "Where was the target last seen?"

"The fashion district." the officer replies and Grawl raises an eyebrow.

"I'm looking for a female, Arsubaran. Olive skin. Dark hair."

The bat-like Keero species Grawl is talking to scoffs. "Oh, an Arsubaran you say. Geez, that narrows it down. Only like a frickin' trillion of them out there."

Grawl looks at the pane of glass the Keero is trying to manuever into place. "Yes, but she most likely broke this window."

"Yeah? Well, pass along my thanks. I gots a weeks worth of work now."

Grawl senses he's getting no where with the busy Keero and decides to head into the store to question the shop manager where he's surprised to find a many tentacled Tetsuashan behind the counter. The Tetsuashan is blunt but directs Grawl to another a street vendor who says they saw the girl.

The street vendor turns out to be a Stakes Tourism Board robot selling maps, translation guides, and vacation packages.

"I saw the beast destroy the neighborhood. Then it became tired and transformed into a girl. Her clothing was in disarray and she grabbed a blue ballgown that was on the street as a result of her carnage. She then fled towards the alley behind that strip of shops." the robot says as the point to a row stores that seemed to have been spared from any external damage.

Grawl heads behind the stores into an service alleyway. Steam rises up from vents and Grawl looks for a way to whatever is underground and finds an access point.

"Hello?" Grawl raises his voice in the darkness of the service tunnels.

A figure steps out from the shadows and Grawl recognizes the face of Tera Valene, the shape-shifting Thald from the casino. "You are the Ryjyllian from the casino?"

Grawl nods and relaxes his stances.

Tera takes another step forward, exterior light from the vent cast across her face. "You said you wouldn't hurt me and your word is your honor."

"I'm not here to hurt you, I'm here to bring you back to Medbase Ultra."

"That would be hurting me." she says as she holds out her arms and turns around to show her back.

Grawl sees marks on her wrist from some form of restraints and scarring on her back. "Are they not helping you... get better?"

"The beast is part of me, not something to be cured." she pauses and adds "Your family, your clan, it is who you are not something to be fixed, yes?"

Grawl nods in understanding. "Come, we cannot stay here."

## Session Notes

In between the last time I played and this session Lampblack & Brimstone released [The Perilous Void][1] billed as "A comprehensive set of content generation tools for the science fiction role-playing game of your choice, created by the same people that brought you The Perilous Wilds." It is very, very good. While I've got a good "broad brushstrokes" setting in _Bulldogs!_ there are not like detailed maps of the various planets, stations, etc. Quite a lot of the galaxy is left open for the gamemaster to make their own, so I will be turning to Perilous Void to fill in the gaps.

For this session I wanted a system a bit more gamified, so I've returned to _Two Hour Wargames' 5150 New Beginnings (2022 Edition)_. While there's no "feline-humanoid" race in 5150 it is not particularly hard to build out Grawl in the system. Rep 5 with the Quick Reflexes attribute. Quick Reflexes lets Grawl "Count Rep at 1 point higher than actual when rolling on the Action Table" which should give them better odds at acting first when establishing turn order in combat. They get a class of "Exotic" ("People with unique jobs") and a profession of "Bounty Hunter." There was no attributes that stood out to me as capturing Ryjyllian qualities such as their fierce loyalty to their family clan or their natural claws. If we take a look at the Melee combat table character can get a +1d6 for either a "Melee Weapon" or a "Physical Enhancement" (cyberware.) So I think we'll just make up an attribute called "Natural Weapon" (the name, borrowed from Savage World) that captures their retractable claws and gives them +1d6 in Melee.

Details such as Medbase Ultra and Infocity all came from the _Bulldogs!_ setting material. When Grawl successfully scored a "Clue" using the 5150 mechanics, I used the [One-Page Mystery Crafter from Mythic Magazine Volume 47][2] to generate prompts as to what the clue was.

Procedurally the game was run using the "Find Encounter" from 5150 - which is a set of rules for locating someone or something, tracking a number of clues until you find the right clue, and has some branching Encounters depending on the nature of the Clues & NPCs you meet. Long-time readers may remember Two Hour Wargames uses a concept of "Increasing D6" and "Decreasing D6" as a means of gamifying advancement, reputation, and upkeep. Grawl earned some Increasing D6 but also spent some as a bonus dice to secure success on some Interactions.

At the end Grawl passed a succesful check to find tunnel entrance. Then I saked Mythic whether the girl was down there and it gave me "Yes" with an Event of "NPC Action." I rolled up to "Element Meaning" words from the "Character Action" table and got "Trust, Powerful." According to _Bulldogs!_ lore, Ryjyllians are famously honorable and so I figured the girl would rely on Grawl to keep his word.
