After searching Piper's brothers apartment I had nothing to give her but the bill and a bad feeling that was curdling in my gut. The local syndicate was on our trail and I decided it was best to get back to my apartment to regroup.

We took the elevator up to my floor and stepped out into a corridor, the flickering lumo-panels casting a dimly blue pallor over the metal walls. My door was at the end of the hall. My place. My sanctuary of cheap synth-whiskey... but something was off. The air was wrong. It's a smell you learn, a mix of recycled ozone with cheap cologne that doesn't belong. The hair on the back of my neck stood to attention.

I held up a hand, and Piper froze behind me. My fingers closed around the cold, familiar grip of the door handle. It was unlocked. I never forget to lock it. Never.

"Stay behind me," I grunted, the words tasting like ash.

I pushed the door open slow, a sliver at a time. The apartment was dark, the only light the gaudy neon sign from the noodle joint across the street, painting the room in pulsating streaks of red and blue. Everything looked as I left it: the worn plas-leather chair, the dusty data-terminal, the half-empty bottle of synth-whiskey on the counter.

Then the shadows moved.

They came out of the corners like roaches, three of them. Big boys, dressed in the cheap, sharp suits that were the uniform of the Orlov syndicate. Muscle for hire, brains optional.

Time stretched, got thin. The one in the lead, a gorilla with a jawline you could break rocks on, made a beeline for Piper. She let out a short, sharp gasp that was cut off as he wrapped a meaty arm around her, clamping a hand over her mouth. Her eyes were wide, white-rimmed saucers of terror.

The other two came for me. No words. No demands. Just business.

The first one threw a punch that would have rearranged my dental work if I hadn't slipped inside it. I drove my fist into his solar plexus. It was like hitting a brick wall, but the brick wall grunted. The second one came in low, trying to tackle me. I brought my knee up, catching him in the shoulder, spinning him away.

It was a brutal, ugly dance in the strobing neon. I got a few good licks in. Split one's lip, saw the blood look black in the red light. But they were young, strong, and there were two of them. A hard right caught me on the cheekbone, and the world swam for a second. I backed into my own kitchenette, my vision blurring.

That's when I saw the third one, the one holding Piper, nod to the goon in front of me.

This one, a real genius, looked around for something. His eyes landed on my food replicatorâ€”a cheap, clunky model that could barely manage edible protein paste. He ripped it from the counter, wires sparking like dying fireflies.

I was still shaking the stars from my eyes when he swung it.

The world didn't go black. It exploded into a supernova of pain, a silent, shattering impact that started at my temple and rattled the fillings in my teeth. The last thing I saw was the floor rushing up to meet my face, and the last thing I heard was the dame's muffled scream, smothered by a cheap suit jacket.

Then, nothing. Just the long, dark, quiet.

## Session Notes

- Whelp, the rolls did not go in Dalin's favor for this round but I still had an enjoyable session. I forgot to play with any sort of "bennies" or tools to flip odds in my favor and so that probably cost me the session. I have decided yet whether this is the end for Dalin's adventures or not. There are some tools in the Micro Mythic playtest files I still want to try out, so I will certainly keep using them for whatever comes next.
