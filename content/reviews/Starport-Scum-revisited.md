Someone asked over in the [Nordic Weasel Gaming][NWG] discord about folks' experiences using _[Dungeon Scum][]_ or _[Starport Scum][]_ for solo RPGing. Rather than dump a bunch of knowledge into a discord group that is not easily searchable or likely to disappear one day, I figured I would share my experiences here.

If you aren't familiar with the _"Scum"_ line of games they are first and foremost skirmish-level miniature games. What's the difference between an RPG and a "skirmish-level miniature game"? If you squint not much but the rules were written in mind for folks to push figures around a table for the purposes of having them fight each other. The _Scum_ games have the advantage of being written a bit more broadly, as the description says:

> Combining miniatures war gaming with role playing game touches, Starport Scum is playable as a conventional miniatures game, a narrative RPG or a hybrid beast combining the best of both worlds.

While I have read _Dungeon Scum_ I have never played it, so my thoughts will focus entirely on _Starport Scum_ but there are not massive differences between the two games mechanically.

## What makes Starport Scum good for roleplaying?

The main thing that makes Starport Scum ideal for roleplaying is that characters are described with **traits** (equipment can be modeled with **tags**, and scenario objectives with **keys**) - one word or short phrases that give characters abilities, backgrounds, skills, etc. At a abstract level you can think of these like _[Aspects in Fate RPG](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/types-aspects)_ or Descriptors in _[Freeform Universal](https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal/)_ - they provide an almost infinite number of ways to design a character to your liking. This is exciting and a little daunting because I find some players are adverse to so much open-endedness. If you would prefer strictly modeled point-buy style character building, like that of the _HERO System_ or _GURPs_, you will probably not enjoy _Starport Scum_.

The other important thing to know about _Starport Scum_ is that, for the most part, it uses a universal resolution mechanic that is a simple six-sided dice pool system. More dice is better but we are not talking about _Shadowrun_ buckets of 30 dice - in my experience the dice pools are no higher than 5 to 6 dice. Characters belong to one of a few classes: Grunts, Aces, or Heroes. Each class has a base dice pool that you start with but also, in many situations, a max dice pool.

Traits & tags in _Starport Scum_ are not "stats" in the numeric sense, though their mere presence in a situation may increase your base dice pool. In a lot of cases they also provide abilities that "break the rules" - like "Edges" in _Savage Worlds_ or "Feats" in many other RPGs. So your trait or tag might extended the range you can move or shoot, etc. _Starport Scum_ thankfully comes with a lot of example traits & tags but because it is a "skirmish-level miniature game" many of these example traits/tags are going to be combat focused. If you are intending to use _Starport Scum_ strictly as an RPG and plan to have social conflicts or characters doing lots of non-combat tasks like investigations then you will have to do some homework upfront to prep some traits/tags that will be meaningful in your game world. If you do not like GM-prep as part of your solo play then this is likely not the game for you (of course I will also warn you that if you don't like being a solo GM you are limiting yourself to games like _Four Against Darkness_ or _Barbarian Prince_ -- great, fun games but the open-endnesses of these experiences is obviously limited.)

The quirky thing about Starport Scum, as a miniatures game, is that it has a section called "Combat Without Miniatures." It walks through guidance for how to visualize the combat space, estimate measurements, re-thinking movement when doing "theater of the mind", and even tossing all of this detail out the window and letting the description of the situation define the rules.

There are rules for doing "non-combat" things ("Getting Things Done", "Figuring it out", and "Talking it out") which can be generally applied to lots of common RPG situations.

Finally, like most RPGs (not all, looking at you _Classic Traveller_), there are rules for advancement.

## Okay, how do I play Starport Scum by myself?

If you are familiar with other Nordic Weasel Games titles like _[Five Parsecs From Home][]_, you might be expecting a tightly integrated system of random tables that you roll dice and on, thus largely eliminating the need for a Gamemaster. _Starport Scum_ has a LOT of random tables - tables for helping generate scenarios, characters, loot, etc but they are not as tightly interlinked - it is more of a toolkit.

When I pickup a game to play solo I typically look for the advancement rules to figure out what the "gameloop" is - by that I mean - what do the designers of this game think I'm going to sit down and do in order to play the game? In Starport Scum it is pretty straightforward:

> First, by wild west rules: Knock down someone as big or bigger than yourself.  
> Second, by saving the day (find a character that achieved the objective, saved the day, held off the enemy or otherwise did good)

To trigger the first rule, you need to get into combat. To trigger the second rule you need to pick up a Job. Thankfully Jobs will often lead to combat. So that's the game loop - get a job, get into combat. Doing those things will let your PCs improve (and gather Credits and Loot which will give you better gear with tags that will help you achieve the first advancement rule more often.) That's it. If you want to do anything else in this game you will have to figure out for yourself how to make it happen. (Although keep reading on for how to make social conflict rewarding.)

For those pesky times when you would ask a Gamemaster "ok, it is a starport warehouse with lots of crates around but is there a service crane I could leap up and grab the hook of to swing my character up to the gantry that lines the exterior of this warehouse?" you might want we call a "yes/no" oracle in solo play. There is no "Yes/No" Oracle in the core _Starport Scum_ rules, for that you will need to pick up the _[Storyteller's Guide to Starport Scum][]_. At only $2.99 USD (as of the time of writing) it is a very good investment because it expands the core rules with a couple of sub-systems that I have found necessary for RPG-style play. The most important is the "Social Combat" procedures which takes the melee/ranged combat procedures but tweaks them for witty arguments or dramatic social situations. That said, the "Yes/no" Oracle in the _Storyteller's Guide_ is lackluster, not really integrated into the normal mechanics at all, and if you have a favorite oracle from elsewhere you would be better served by sticking to it.

There is guidance in the core book about how to manage your RPG sessions as a campaign. _Starport Scum_ is a job-driven game - your PCs are expected to be a group that works for hire and goes one job to the next always looking for the next job. The job system "game loop" is not nearly as tightly defined as that in _Five Parsecs_, it is much closer to something like _Classic Traveller's_ largely freeform Patron game loop BUT _Starport Scum_ does a better job of defining several job types in procedural form. The core book provides the following jobs:

- Salvage: fight over loot on board derelict ships
- Security: escort a VIP somewhere
- Law enforcement: deal with a local gang or wanted bounty
- Dirty: assassinate someone of value
- Merc: fight someone else's war
- Survey: scout out a location

All of the jobs come with a customized table that tell you who you employer will be, what the goal is, and location details. In addition there is guidance for setting up the "battle field" and what rewards your PCs can expect for finishing the job. Sometimes there are additional hooks for taking the job, like people taking more notice of your PCs - therefore creating future situations (tracked by a "Heat level") where you PCs might suddenly have a random encounter to deal with an old rival or competing faction.

There is a $1.99 USD [expanded jobs guide](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/205731/Starport-Scum-Jobs-Guide) which adds on four additional types:

- Search: Find a specific item or person
- Recon: Survey a location (possibly for a related job)
- Bail out: "Get out of a dodge" - things have gone south and your PCs must escape
- Face off: Deal with an enemy in a showdown

In addition there is a $2.99 USD expansion called _[Survey and Explore][]_ which provides procedures for hexcrawl-style world exploring. If you what you prefer is almost a _Star Trek_ style exploration team dealing with strange environments, unknown aliens, and weird animals then you want this.

At this point it is worth pointing out that there is a [_Starport Scum_ "epic bundle"](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/206339/Starport-Scum-Epic-BUNDLE) for $28.42 (USD) that comes with everything I've mentioned plus expanded loot, a lot more Guns, vehicle rules, and some rules variations.

So the job framework provides the engine that makes the game "play itself" in a way - your PCs get a job, that initiates the conflict, you generate the enemies and if you succeed then you get the rewards (all while your Heat Level goes up with each new job which increases the likelihood of random encounter) Doing all of this will populate list of allies, enemies, factions, etc.

## Do I need to "journal" my play?

_Starport Scum_ is not a journaling game. This is a weird topic in solo RPGing. There are indeed an entire class of games for solo play that are "journaling games." In general the framework for such games is that you get a "prompt" and you write out your character's reaction to the prompt - you are roleplaying what your character does by answering the prompt. How "gamified" that is varies from title to title.

There is zero requirement to "journal" anything in Starport Scum (I would argue the same is true for games that are often painted with the "journaling" brush, such as _Ironsworn_ or _Starforged_ - two games I have played extensively and never journaled once when doing so.)

You DO need to write some things down. What are the character's traits? What is the Heat level? What job are you currently doing? What loot did you find? Etc. I don't see that as journaling... as a kid when I explored dungeons in _D&D_ or went from planet to planet in _Traveller_ I made MANY notes on my character sheet or pieces of lined paper I ripped out of my school notebooks about what was going on. Sometimes this concept is called ["Bluebook Roleplaying"](https://wiki.rpg.net/index.php/Bluebooking).

When you play in a group there's a GM and friends at the table who can help each other remember all the little stuff ("Hey, didn't we meet a barkeep three towns ago that heard a rumor about the _Sword of Darkness_?") but when you play on your own... like that's a ridiculous amount of detail to keep in your head. For me I write down just the essential bits of info I need to know so that when I put my game down one day and pick it up agin the next time I can start playing again.

When some characters are talking I do not write out a novel about what they are doing - instead I just make a note about who was involved and what the crux of what they talked about. "Bill and Ted agreed on a 3 credit reward for the job after Ted negotiated a better deal."

I keep a list of all the characters my PCs have interacted with a brief mention of the location (planet) and maybe a job or faction they are linked to. Mostly this is so I can reuse them later instead of constantly having to generate new characters over and over.

When characters are in combat, I might sketch out a picture of the battle area. I will make note of any special weapon tags that a figure has. I don't write out all the things a character is _thinking_ to themselves or _yelling_ across the battlefield. That all happens in my head. Once we get beyond like 4 characters in combat I typically move to some kind of miniatures setup - that might just be what really amounts to digital counters on a digital surface. Think Microsoft Powerpoint - seriously just imagine a bunch of triangles (PCs), squares (NPCs), and some doodles that are the terrain. I might use color to note the "boss" or throw some weird wingbats (stars, whatever) down to mark key scenario items. This is so I can track position, movement, cover, etc. It can be hard at the 6 to 10 figure level to really "theater of the mind" all the flanking possibilities for example - so that's why I use visuals. Is that journaling? I don't think so but it is "writing things down" to an extent.

Does this sound like being a gamemaster (GM)? Yes, it is. For open-world style RPG play you cannot take the "GM" duties out of the game. Even if you said "I'm going to let ChatGPT do all of that." you still have to seed ChatGPT with all the assumptions of you game world - is there gravity? Faster than light travel? Are there futuristic laser guns or just modern day ones? Those are all GM decisions. Also, good luck having even the highest end AI on the market remember all the details of your current game world for you. (None of them can keep up with the type of sandbox worlds I play in and most of them are terrible with numbers.)

If you don't like the idea of taking any notes while you play I don't think this type of solo RPGing is for you. Something more guided like the _Fighting Fantasy_ gamebooks will be better suited to the amount of effort you are wiling to put in.

## What if I want something more open-ended?

If you want a more "sandbox" like experience, then you will likely need to pair _Starport Scum_ with some other tools - like _Stars Without Number_'s sector and faction systems or the [Mythic Gamemaster Emulator](https://www.wordmillgames.com/mythic.html). There are a lot of random tables in _Starport Scum_ such as:

- Corporation generator
- Political group generator
- Faction generator
- People met
- Patrons
- World generator
- Colony & Space station generator
- News Headline generator (great for scenario prompts)
- Casual encounters (good for rumors, downtime)
- Detailed enemy generator (dice pools, weapons, etc)

But these tables are somewhat limited in their use. You could go through them a few times and have a really solid campaign, after that you would find many of the results somewhat repetitive.

## "Balancing" encounters for solo play

Game balance is one of those controversial topics but for a solo player it is helpful to know "do I need to house rule character creation so my character doesn't die in the first encounter?" No. In play I found that if I made my main PC a "Hero" and threw a handful of enemies at them they could handle themselves fine. In some situations you will probably want at least a "Hero" and an "Ace" (your trusty "sidekick") to make survival more likely. "Goons" are pretty easily tossed aside because of how the rules treat them. There are not "hit points" in this game - that's pretty unusual in miniatures gaming from my experience, instead characters are either "pinned" or "wounded" or "taken out" - something more akin to "wound levels" in the RPG space. 

## What's missing from Starport Scum that might hinder solo play?

If you want "starship combat" you are going to need to bolt-on a system. There's an expansion _"Vehicle Manual"_ but it is intended for military-style land vehicles. I did use the ideas in this guide to model movement at Starship scale and it [worked fine in the abstract](https://post79.com/2024/02/7/season-1-episode-4) but I don't think it would be satisfying if you want something more detailed.

There is no trading system in Starport Scum so if you what want is "group of PCs own a ship, pay the mortgage through trade" you will have to bolt-on your own trading system. What little trade exists in the implied setting is very much barter-driven.

World generation is pretty limited in the core book - if you want really hostile environments that **mechanically** effect the PCs you will want the _Survey and Explore_ expansion. I constantly found myself turning to outside sources for generating more details about the planets I was on because what the book provides is very limited from a roleplaying perspective. Are there asteroids in this system I can hide a ship in? Are the Law Enforcement on this planet particularly annoying? What weapons are legal on this world? Stuff like that...

Likewise, there are no rules to generate a "subsector" of space - or even really rules detailing travel from one planet to another. The assumption is more like say the TV show Stargate - your PCs are going from one world to another, you are going to jump straight into the situation that needs to be handled, you will take your licks, and get ready to rinse-lather-repeat. If you want a very detailed handling of fuel cost, ammunition, etc - I don't think this is the game for you because you would have to bolt-on so many additional subsystems to make it work. _Starport Scum_ is really much more about giving character traits and putting them into situations that test how effective those traits are. The way traits work and say, managing how long your "torch stays lit" (to steal a bit of minutiae from the old school days of dungeon crawling) are kinda of at odds with each other. (_Dungeon Scum_ does mention torches by the way but the importance of them is a light source for visibility and the effect it has on range in encounters.)

There are not really procedures for like "daily" encounters - so if you are looking for like "X in 6" chance of a random casual encounter or a "X in 6" chance of the Starport Custom's Officer stopping you for inspection, you will need to come up with your own procedures.

There is very little in the core book that is going to give you detailed PC and NPC backgrounds. As a solo player that's a gap you will need to fill with your imagination or another tool like the - [The Universal NPC Emulator](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134163/UNE-The-Universal-NPC-Emulator-rev)

## Expanded observations on Starport Scum

- There's an implied setting in Starport Scum but it is not firmly baked in. If you want "Firefly" or "Star Wars Rebels" you can get there but you have to do the GM Prep to pick & choose from the existing traits & tags or customize new ones to make that happen.
- In solo play, I got a lot of use out of the "Getting Things Done" and "Talking it Out" rules from the core book - I'd read and re-read those rules to memorize them. Looking back through my raw game session notes I used the "Talking it Out" rules A LOT.
- I really think the "Social Combat" in the _Storyteller's Guide_ is an excellent addition to the Core Rules - it helps gamify those social situations which is ideal for solo play. You can also look at that system, see how they modified the physical combat systems, and think how you would extend it to things like "Investigations" or "Chases" because the framework for modifying the core dice pool mechanic is right there for you to work with.
- I wrote out a narrative for 11 "episodes" (sessions) of solo Starport Scum play. ("You journaled!" - no, this is not what I wrote down as I played. This is what happened when I looked back at my notes and wrote a narrative that any normal human might want to invest 15 minutes to read through.) At the bottom of each post are usually reflections of what things I felt I had to augment the rules with in order to make the game work for me.
- I have a very lengthy list of [Resources](/resources) I use in my solo play.

## Conclusion

_Starport Scum_ is a toolkit for roleplaying one of more PCs picking up a typical list of "space freelance cowboy" themed jobs and getting into trouble. It allows characters and gear to be meaningful but keeps the amount of detail to something that would fit on a index card per character. There are a fair bit of random tables but they can get repetitive, thankfully the word-based trait system makes it extremely easy to take content from another game on your shelf and translate it to the mechanics of Starport Scum by just assigning it some words (and using the core book's guidance on trait design - "the trait adds/subtracts 1 dice or 1 action or additional movement when doing this specific type of thing.")

The game makes keeping track of play fairly easy as there is not a lot bookkeeping to manage. Because it is a miniatures game, the combat has been quite bit more thought out with procedures for what to do in different situations. It is interesting that so many RPGs are combat-focused but it seems like most of the "rules" have gone into building characters and weapons that do X damage in Y situation. There are rarely rules for flanking, morale, etc in the RPG books I read. It is really weird.

It is not a solo-first game but it easy to solo if you can think of a word or two to describe something, want to play a group of PCs going from job-to-job, and would like to get into some physical combat in the process.
