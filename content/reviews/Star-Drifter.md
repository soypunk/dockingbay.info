> You are a talented pilot with a nebulous past. Your time spent away from your homeworld has been mostly taken up with performing dishonourable jobs for untrustworthy characters. Your most recent run in with the authorities has caused you to question your life’s current trajectory and has you feeling that maybe it is time for a course correction. Equipped with your ray gun, multi-purpose utility pad and modest starship, you are ready to travel the cosmos in your quest for glory. The galaxy is vast, densely populated, full of odd planets, dangerous creatures and intergalactic anomalies. There are humans and aliens that live throughout, in peace and also at war. You simply want to make your mark among the stars.
> 
> Your ship’s panels begin to whirl and flash in a series of coloured lights as you fire
up it’s thrusters to seek your destiny amidst the stars.

This is introductory text to a campaign using [Star Drifter][] from Ken Kennedy who also has brought us the solitaire adventure games: The Drifter (wild west) and Adventurer (fantasy). If you have ever played [Barbarian Prince][] then you'll have a feel for this style of game - there's a hex map, you adventurer through it, and along the way you have a series of randomly generated encounters.

I've played roughly 40 turns so far of Star Drifter and I'm really enjoying it. It does a good job of providing an "unexplored" feeling to the hex map while still offering chances to revisit areas and have new encounters.

There is an implied setting and the player is not required to imagine anything beyond what the prompt provide you but you could bring your own Space Opera setting to the game if you wanted to have a feeling of a lone pilot exploring your favorite piece of sci-fi media.

I printed out all of the components at home and it was easy to use. I ultimately ended up using a "virtual tabletop" of sorts by loading in the digital version of the sheets into Apple's Freeform application. I keep the character sheet, ship sheet, and map in a Freeform document. Alongside that I maintain a plain-text log of the series of turns and encounters I've had.

The game feels fairly dynamic with over 250+ events. In addition some events chain into others and you can get different combinations each time, so nothing feels particularly repetitive.

It is a random table heavy game and there are times where you are at the whims of the dice rolls. For skill checks and combat situations you do have a pool of points to use for re-rolls and there are numerous items to discover throughout the game that will give you a leg up on the opponents. 

Ship combat, which can often feel pretty boring in many RPGs, is fun and fast. It is not uncommon for your sole ship to have to battle it out with 5 other star fighter from a local sector authority military patrol and these fights never feel tedious. 

As always whenever I'm playing a game I'm almost always thinking about the next one -- in this case I was thinking that if you kept a decent record of what happens where along the way, you'd have an interesting galaxy map to play with using a different game system later. For example you'll know which hexes have particularly aggressive military patrols, restricted zones, planets with crashed ships to scavenge or explore, and so on.

Overall, if you like the style of game that The Drifter or Barbarian Prince produce then I can highly recommend Star Drifter. You won't need any other resources outside of the 276 page book and print-and-play components that are provided to you. While 270+ pages sounds like a lot the actual "rules" you need to internalize are maybe 5 pages. The rest of the book is just the event situations and their corresponding random tables. The digital version of the PDF book includes hyperlinks so it is easy to jump around the text with a lot of "page flipping."
