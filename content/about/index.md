**Docking Bay** is a chronicle of experiences written from the perspective of characters in science-fiction miniatures or roleplaying games. Generally these roleplaying sessions are played "solo", without a GM or other players. The author uses a combination of roleplaying game systems and gamemaster tools that help adjudicate situations fairly given the context of the situations characters find themselves in.

The initial focus for these adventures will be in a far-future universe populated with bounty hunters, traders, smugglers, robots, and plenty of humanoid aliens.

Thanks to [Andy Slack and his blog Halfway Station](https://hws4.wordpress.com/) for inspiring this project and to [Word Mill Games][3] for publishing tools that help facilitate roleplaying games without the need for a dedicated gamemaster.

Some game sessions use content from Far Future Enterprises Traveller RPG. The Traveller game in all forms is owned by [Far Future Enterprises][1]. [Copyright 1977 - 2008 Far Future Enterprises][2].
